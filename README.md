# belly-button-challenge
This repository demonstartes an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalog the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard includes a bar graph with a dropdown menu, a bubble chart, and each individual's demographic information. 

The bar graph illustrates the top 10 most occuring bacteria in the navel of a given test subject. The bubble chart displays each sample, with size of each bubble in relation to amount of bacteria discovered per sample. Last but not least, the demographic chart provides key information on the test subject, such as ethnicity, gender, age, wash frequency, and more. 

App.js contains all javascript code done to build the interactive dashboard. This file is located in the static folder.
